    <h1>Essay Writing <span><h3>(In simple Essay Writing )</h3></span></h1>
<p>This resource begins with a general description of essay writing and moves 
    to a discussion of common essay genres students may encounter across the 
    curriculum.The four genres of essays (description, narration, exposition,
    and argumentation) are common paper assignments you may encounter in your 
    writing classes.Although these genres, also known as the modes of discourse,
    have been criticized by some composition scholars, the Purdue OWL recognizes
    the wide spread use of these genres and students' need to understand and
    produce these types of essays. We hope these resources will help.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The essay is a commonly assigned form of writing that every student will encounter 
        while in academia. Therefore, it is wise for the student to become
    capable and comfortable with this type of writing early on in her training.
    Essays can be a rewarding and challenging type of writing and are often assigned either to be 
    done in class, which requires previous planning and practice (and a bit of creativity) on the part of the student,
    or as homework, which likewise demands a certain amount of preparation. 
    Many poorly crafted essays have been produced on account of a lack of preparation and confidence. 
    However, students can avoid the discomfort often associated with essay writing by understanding some common genres.
    <br>
    Before delving into its various genres, 
    let's begin with a basic definition of the essay.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>WHAT IS AN ESSAY?</h2>
    <p>
        Though the word essay has come to be understood as a type of writing in Modern English, 
        its origins provide us with some useful insights. The word comes into the English language
        through the French influence on Middle English; tracing it back further, 
        we find that the French form of the word comes from the Latin verb exigere, 
        which means "to examine, test, or (literally) to drive out." 
        Through the excavation of this ancient word, we are able to unearth the essence of the academic 
        essay: to encourage students to test or examine their ideas concerning a particular topic.
        Essays are shorter pieces of writing that often require the student to hone a number of 
        skills such as close reading, analysis, comparison and contrast, persuasion, conciseness, 
        clarity, and exposition. As is evidenced by this list of attributes, there is much to 
        be gained by the student who strives to succeed at essay writing.        
        The purpose of an essay is to encourage students to develop ideas and 
        concepts in their writing with the direction of little more than their own thoughts (it may be helpful to 
        view the essay as the converse of a research paper). Therefore, essays are (by nature) concise and require clarity 
        in purpose and direction. This means that there is no room for the student's thoughts to 
        wander or stray from his or her purpose; the writing must be deliberate and interesting.
        This handout should help students become familiar and comfortable with the process of essay 
        composition through the introduction of some common essay genres.
        This handout includes a brief introduction to the following genres of essay writing:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Expository Essays</h1><br>
    <h2>WHAT IS AN EXPOSITORY ESSAY?</h2>
        <p>The expository essay is a genre of essay that requires the student to investigate an idea, evaluate evidence, expound on the idea,
        and set forth an argument concerning that idea in a clear and concise manner. This can be accomplished through comparison and contrast, 
        definition, example, the analysis of cause and effect, etc.
        
        <h3> note: </h3> genre is commonly assigned as a tool for classroom evaluation and is often found in various exam formats.<br>

        A clear, concise, and defined thesis statement that occurs in the first paragraph of the essay.<br>
        It is essential that this thesis statement be appropriately narrowed to follow the guidelines set forth in the assignment. If the student 
        does not master this portion of the essay, it will be quite difficult to compose an effective or persuasive essay.<br>
        
        Clear and logical transitions between the introduction, body, and conclusion.<br>
        Transitions are the mortar that holds the foundation of the essay together. Without logical progression of thought, 
        the reader is unable to follow the essay's argument, and the structure will collapse.<br>
        
        Body paragraphs that include evidential support.<br>
        Each paragraph should be limited to the exposition of one general idea. This will allow for clarity and direction throughout the essay. 
        What is more, such conciseness creates an ease of readability for one's audience. It is important to note that each paragraph in the body 
        of the essay must have some logical connection to the thesis statement in the opening paragraph.<br>
        
        Evidential support (whether factual, logical, statistical, or anecdotal).<br>
        Often times, students are required to write expository essays with little or no preparation; therefore, such essays do not typically allow 
        for a great deal of statistical or factual evidence.<br>
        
        <h3>A bit of creativity!</h3><br>
        Though creativity and artfulness are not always associated with essay writing, it is an art form nonetheless. Try not to get stuck on the 
        formulaic nature of expository writing at the expense of writing something interesting. Remember, though you may not be crafting the next 
        great novel, you are attempting to leave a lasting impression on the people evaluating your essay.<br>
        
        A conclusion that does not simply restate the thesis, but readdresses it in light of the evidence provided.<br>
        It is at this point of the essay that students will inevitably begin to struggle. This is the portion of the essay that will leave the most 
        immediate impression on the mind of the reader. Therefore, it must be effective and logical. Do not introduce any new information into the conclusion; 
        rather, synthesize and come to a conclusion concerning the information presented in the body of the essay.<br>
        
        <h3>A COMPLETE ARGUMENT</h3><br>
        Perhaps it is helpful to think of an essay in terms of a conversation or debate with a classmate. If I were to discuss the cause of the Great Depression 
        and its current effect on those who lived through the tumultuous time, there would be a beginning, middle, and end to the conversation. In fact, if I were 
        to end the exposition in the middle of my second point, questions would arise concerning the current effects on those who lived through the Depression. 
        Therefore, the expository essay must be complete, and logically so, leaving no doubt as to its intent or argument.<br>
        
        <h3>FIVE-PARAGRAPH ESSAY</h3><br>
        A common method for writing an expository essay is the five-paragraph approach. This is, however, by no means the only formula for writing such essays. 
        If it sounds straightforward, that is because it is; in fact, the method consists of:<br>
        
        an introductory paragraph<br>
        three evidentiary body paragraphs<br>
        a conclusion</p>
